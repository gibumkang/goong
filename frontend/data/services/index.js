            Wouldn't it be nice if you had a personal web developer that designs, builds, and maintains your website 24/7?
			We understand that you are busy and don't have time to maintain things yourself. Delegate this task to us
			so you can focus on what really matters: Your business.
        </p>
		<p>
			Maybe you've dabbled in things like Wix or Squarespace. These website builders pose more problems than solutions over time.
			They operate slower because there is a lot of complex code to offer a builder platform. Secondly, the interface
			will change over time. The system can change overnight and you will need to re-learn how to make simple changes
			all over again. Lastly, because builder websites will always be limited in terms of modularity. Your website
			will face scaling issues when it is time to upgrade your website. The best solution is to create a website on a clean slate.
		</p>
		<p>
			Kanvas websites are created by professionals, utilizing the latest technology such as JAMStack and Reactjs. Automated web builders like
			Wix will never replace the human element we have at Kanvas.
